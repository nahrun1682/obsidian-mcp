## File Operations

### read-note

Read the contents of a note file.

#### Parameters

- `path` (string, required) - Path to the note file (e.g., "folder/note.md")

#### Example

```
"Read my project note at Projects/MCP-Server.md"
```

---

### read-notes

Read multiple notes in a single request for improved efficiency.

#### Parameters

- `paths` (array of strings, required) - Array of note file paths

#### Features

- Handles partial success (returns successful reads even if some files fail)
- More efficient than multiple `read-note` calls

#### Example

```
"Read all my daily notes from Journal/2024-01.md, Journal/2024-02.md, and Journal/2024-03.md"
```

---

#### Parameters

- `path` (string, required) - Path for the new note
- `content` (string, required) - Content of the note
- `overwrite` (boolean, optional, default: false) - Overwrite if file exists

#### Features

- Automatically creates parent directories if needed
- Fails if file exists (unless overwrite is true)

#### Example

```
"Create a new meeting note in Work/Meetings/2024-01-15.md with the standup agenda"
```

---

### edit-note

Replace the entire content of an existing note.

```

---

### delete-note

Permanently delete a note file from the vault.

#### Parameters

```

---

### move-note

Move a note to a different directory or rename it.

#### Parameters

- `source_path` (string, required) - Current path of the file
- `destination_path` (string, required) - New path for the file
- `overwrite` (boolean, optional, default: false) - Overwrite if destination exists

#### Example

```
"Move Work/temp.md to Archive/2024/temp.md"
```

---

### append-content

Append content to the end of an existing note, or create a new note if it doesn't exist.

#### Parameters

- `path` (string, required) - Path to the file
- `content` (string, required) - Content to append
- `create_if_missing` (boolean, optional, default: true) - Create file if it doesn't exist
- `newline` (boolean, optional, default: true) - Add newline before content

#### Example

```
"Add a new task to my TODO.md: '- Review pull requests'"
```

---

### patch-content

Insert or update content at specific locations using semantic anchors.

#### Parameters

- `path` (string, required) - Path to the file
- `content` (string, required) - Content to insert
- `anchor_type` (string, required) - Type of anchor: "heading", "block", "frontmatter", or "text_match"
- `anchor_value` (string, required) - The anchor to match (heading name, block ID, frontmatter key, or text content)
- `position` (string, required) - Where to insert: "before", "after", or "replace"
- `create_if_missing` (boolean, optional, default: true) - Create file if missing

#### Anchor Types

#### heading

Matches Markdown headings (e.g., `## Section Title`).

#### Example

```
"Add a new section after the '## Introduction' heading"
```

#### block

Matches Obsidian block identifiers (e.g., `^block-id`).

#### Example

```
"Insert content after the paragraph with ^important-note"
```

#### frontmatter

Updates YAML frontmatter key-value pairs. Creates frontmatter if it doesn't exist. Position is always 'replace'.

#### Example

```
"Update the tags in the frontmatter to include 'project' and 'active'"
```

#### text_match

Matches exact text content (single-line or multi-line). **Recommended for precise targeting.**

#### Features

- Multi-line support: Use `\n` to match multiple consecutive lines for uniqueness
- Ambiguity detection: Fails with helpful error if pattern matches multiple locations
- Error guidance: Shows all match locations with context
- Exact whitespace matching (preserves spaces, tabs, indentation)

#### Example

```
"Insert a note after the paragraph that says 'This is important'"
```

#### When to use text_match

- Need precise content matching without relying on line numbers
- Same text appears multiple times (add surrounding lines for uniqueness)
- Want to ensure match is still valid even if file content changes

---

### apply-diff-patch

Apply a unified diff patch to a file using standard diff format.

#### Parameters

- `path` (string, required) - Path to the file to patch
- `diff` (string, required) - Unified diff patch in standard format

#### Features

- Supports multi-hunk diffs (multiple changes in one patch)
- Strict matching (no fuzz) - patch must match current file content exactly
- Standard unified diff format (same as git diff)

#### Example diff format

```
@@ -10,3 +10,3 @@
 Context line before
-Old content to replace
+New content here
 Context line after
```

#### When to use

- You have a unified diff patch from another source or tool
- Want to make multiple precise changes at specific line numbers
- Prefer standard diff format over anchor-based patching
- LLM naturally generated changes in diff format

#### Comparison with patch-content

- `patch-content` uses semantic anchors (headings, blocks, text patterns) - better when file structure changes
- `apply-diff-patch` uses line numbers - better for precise, multiple edits at known locations

---
